# 🚨 HOW TO DOWNLOAD THIS PROJECT

## The Problem

The path `/tmp/cc-agent/60663306/codecraft-marketing-complete.tar.gz` is on the **SERVER**, not your computer. You cannot access it directly from your browser.

## ✅ SOLUTION: How to Download

You are using a **web-based code editor**. Here's how to download:

### Look for the Download Button

Your platform should have a download/export feature:

- **Bolt.new**: Look for Download icon in top-right corner
- **StackBlitz**: File → Export to ZIP
- **CodeSandbox**: File → Export to ZIP
- **Replit**: Three dots menu → Download as ZIP

### Can't Find It? Screenshot Your Interface

Take a screenshot of your screen and I can tell you exactly where the download button is for your platform.

## 📦 What You Need to Download

Make sure you get the ENTIRE `project` folder with:

- All HTML files (index.html, products.html, etc.)
- `admin/` folder
- `assets/` folder
- `supabase/migrations/` folder (14 files)
- `database-export/` folder
- `package.json`
- `.env` file

## After Downloading

1. Extract ZIP on your computer
2. Open folder in VS Code
3. Run: `npm install`
4. Update `.env` with Supabase credentials
5. Run: `npm run dev`
